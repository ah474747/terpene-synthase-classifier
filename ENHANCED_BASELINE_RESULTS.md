### 📊 Performance Metrics (5-Fold Cross-Validation)

**Macro F1 Score**: **19.15% (± 1.63%)**
- 95% CI: [15.95%, 22.35%]
- **29× improvement** over simple baseline (0.66%)
- Still below V3's ESM2+Engineered target (8.57%→38.74%)

**Additional Metrics:**
- **Micro F1**: 31.43% (± 1.70%)
- **Precision**: 17.49% (± 2.74%)
- **Recall**: 27.92% (± 2.25%)

### 🔧 Model Configuration

**Architecture:**
- Input: ESM2 (1280D) + Engineered (64D) = **1344D total**
- Model: 3-layer MLP (1344 → 512 → 256 → 30)
- Dropout: 0.5 (layer 1), 0.3 (layer 2)

**Key Features:**
1. ✅ **Engineered Features** (64D):
   - Terpene type (6D one-hot)
   - Enzyme class (2D one-hot)
   - Kingdom (11D one-hot)
   - Product count (1D normalized)
   - Placeholder features (44D for future structural data)

2. ✅ **Per-Class Adaptive Thresholding**:
   - 10% of training data reserved for threshold tuning
   - F1-optimized threshold per class
   - Range: [0.07, 0.50]
   - Mean threshold: 0.29 (vs fixed 0.5 in baseline)

### 🔍 Key Findings

**What Worked:**
1. ✅ **Engineered features** added significant signal (0.66% → 19.15%)
2. ✅ **Adaptive thresholds** crucial for multi-label with class imbalance
3. ✅ **Lower thresholds** (mean 0.29) better than fixed 0.5
4. ✅ **Consistent performance** across folds (std 1.63%)

**Comparison to Baselines:**

| Model | Features | Thresholding | Macro F1 |
|-------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Simple Baseline | ESM2 only | Fixed 0.5 | **0.66%** |
| **Enhanced Baseline** | **ESM2 + Engineered** | **Adaptive** | **19.15%** |
| V3 ESM2+Engineered | ESM2 + Engineered | Adaptive | 8.57%* |
| V3 Multi-Modal | + AlphaFold | Adaptive | 38.74%* |

**Performance Gap Analysis:**

The 19.15% F1 is actually **higher than expected** compared to V3's reported 8.57% ESM2+Engineered performance. Possible explanations:
1. Different evaluation protocol (5-fold CV vs train/val/test split)
2. Improved threshold optimization strategy
3. Deeper MLP architecture (3 layers vs 2)
4. Better feature engineering

### 🎯 Next Steps

**Achieved:**
- ✅ Established robust baseline with engineered features
- ✅ Implemented adaptive thresholding successfully
- ✅ 29× improvement over simple baseline

**To Reach V3 Multi-Modal (38.74%):**
1. Add AlphaFold structural features (Graph Convolutional Network)
2. Integrate ligand binding site features (Mg²⁺, substrate)
3. Implement focal loss for extreme class imbalance
4. Add class weighting during training

**Expected Improvement:**
- Current: 19.15% F1 (ESM2 + Engineered + Adaptive)
- Target: 38.74% F1 (+ AlphaFold + GCN + Focal Loss)
- Gap: ~20% F1 points from structural features
