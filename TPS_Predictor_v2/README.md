# Terpene Synthase Product Predictor v2

A state-of-the-art machine learning system for predicting terpene products from synthase protein sequences using protein language models and molecular fingerprints.

## üéØ Objective

Build a robust model that predicts specific terpene products (limonene, pinene, myrcene, etc.) synthesized by terpene synthases using:
- **SaProt** protein language model for sequence embeddings
- **Molecular fingerprints** for terpene product representation
- **Attention mechanisms** for interpretable predictions
- **Multi-class classification** for diverse terpene products

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Sources
- **BRENDA Database**: Curated enzyme data with verified products
- **UniProt**: Manual curation pipeline for sequence annotation
- **Literature Mining**: Extract verified products from research papers

### Model Components
- **SaProt Encoder**: Domain-specific protein embeddings
- **Molecular Encoder**: SMILES ‚Üí RDKit fingerprints
- **Attention Classifier**: Multi-class prediction with interpretability
- **Ensemble Model**: Combine multiple approaches for robustness

### Key Features
- **Balanced Training**: Handle class imbalance properly
- **Cross-Validation**: Robust evaluation on real biological data
- **Biological Validation**: Test on unseen organisms
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence scores for predictions
