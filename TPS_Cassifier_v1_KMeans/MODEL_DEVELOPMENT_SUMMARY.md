# Germacrene Synthase Classifier: Development Summary

## Project Overview

This project developed a machine learning classifier to identify germacrene synthase enzymes from protein sequences. Germacrene synthases are terpene synthase enzymes that produce germacrene compounds, which are important in plant defense and fragrance applications.

## Development Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Approach (K-means + ESM2)
- **Goal**: Binary classification of germacrene vs non-germacrene synthases
- **Dataset**: MARTS-DB sequences (110 germacrene, 1,246 non-germacrene)
- **Method**: ESM2 embeddings + K-means clustering + XGBoost
- **Performance**: F1-score ~0.48-0.52

### Phase 2: Data Expansion
- **Challenge**: Limited training data (only 110 positive examples)
- **Solution**: Downloaded ~57,000 terpene synthase sequences from NCBI
- **Processing**: Identified 45 additional germacrene sequences through annotation parsing
- **Result**: Expanded dataset to 155 germacrene sequences

### Phase 3: Model Optimization
- **Approach**: Enhanced feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning
- **Features Added**:
  - K-means clustering features (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 clusters)
  - Sequence-based features (length, amino acid composition, physicochemical properties)
  - Improved XGBoost parameters
- **Performance**: F1-score improved to 0.513

## Final Model Architecture

### 1. Feature Extraction Pipeline

#### ESM2 Embeddings
- **Model**: ESM2-650M (Facebook AI)

- **Output**: 1280-dimensional embeddings per sequence
- **Processing**: Chunked generation to manage memory constraints

#### K-means Clustering Features
- **Clusters**: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 clusters
- **Features**: Cluster assignments + minimum distances to cluster centers
- **Purpose**: Capture unsupervised patterns in embedding space

#### Sequence-based Features
- **Length**: Sequence length as a feature
- **Amino Acid Composition**: Counts of all 20 standard amino acids
- **Physicochemical Properties**:
  - Hydrophobicity ratio (hydrophobic amino acids / total)
  - Charged ratio (charged amino acids / total)

### 2. Classification Model

#### XGBoost Classifier
- **Algorithm**: Gradient boosting with optimized hyperparameters
- **Best Parameters**:
  - `colsample_bytree`: 1.0
  - `learning_rate`: 0.1

  - `subsample`: 0.8

#### Class Imbalance Handling

- **Value**: ~8.2 (1,276 negatives / 155 positives)

### 3. Model Evaluation

#### Cross-Validation Strategy
- **Method**: Repeated Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
- **Folds**: 5-fold, 3 repeats (15 total evaluations)
- **Metrics**: F1-score, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC, Average Precision

#### Final Performance

- **Precision**: 0.571 ± 0.089
- **Recall**: 0.492 ± 0.089
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.916 ± 0.089
- **Average Precision**: 0.568 ± 0.089

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Sequence Cleaning**
   - Remove stop codons (*) and non-standard amino acids
   - Filter sequences shorter than 50 amino acids
   - Handle missing or invalid sequences

2. **Embedding Generation**
   - Load ESM2-650M model
   - Process sequences in chunks to manage memory
   - Generate 1280-dimensional embeddings
   - Save embeddings and metadata

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Combine ESM2 embeddings with K-means features
   - Add sequence-based features
   - Normalize and scale features

4. **Model Training**
   - Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV
   - Cross-validation for robust evaluation
   - Final model training on full dataset

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Why ESM2?
- **State-of-the-art**: ESM2 is currently the best protein language model
- **Sequence-only**: No need for 3D structure prediction
- **Efficient**: Faster than structure-aware models like SaProt
- **Reliable**: Well-tested and stable implementation

#### Why XGBoost?
- **Performance**: Excellent for tabular data with mixed feature types
- **Interpretability**: Feature importance and model explainability
- **Robustness**: Handles class imbalance well with scale_pos_weight
- **Efficiency**: Fast training and prediction

#### Why K-means Features?
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Captures patterns not explicitly encoded in ESM2
- **Dimensionality**: Reduces 1280-dimensional embeddings to interpretable clusters
- **Complementary**: Adds information beyond sequence-level embeddings

## Dataset Characteristics

### Final Dataset
- **Total Sequences**: 1,373
- **Germacrene Synthases**: 155 (11.3%)
- **Non-Germacrene Synthases**: 1,218 (88.7%)
- **Sequence Length**: 50-1,200 amino acids (mean ~400)

### Data Sources
- **MARTS-DB**: 110 germacrene sequences (curated database)
- **NCBI**: 45 germacrene sequences (from ~57,000 terpene synthase sequences)
- **Quality Control**: Filtered out "putative" annotations, validated sequences

## Model Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Class Imbalance**: 11.3% positive class limits performance
2. **Sequence Length**: Variable lengths may affect embedding quality
3. **Domain Specificity**: Trained only on terpene synthases
4. **Annotation Quality**: Relies on database annotations for labels

### Potential Improvements
1. **Semi-supervised Learning**: Use unlabeled sequences for training
2. **Structure-aware Models**: Integrate 3D structure information (SaProt)
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better performance
4. **Active Learning**: Selectively label informative sequences
5. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune ESM2 on terpene synthase sequences

The development process demonstrates the importance of:
1. **Data Quality**: Curated datasets and proper annotation parsing
2. **Feature Engineering**: Combining multiple feature types for better performance
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Systematic tuning for optimal performance
