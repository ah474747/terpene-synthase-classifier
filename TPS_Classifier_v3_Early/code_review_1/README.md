## 🎯 **Review Objectives**

### **Primary Review Areas:**
1. **Architecture Design** - Multi-modal fusion approach and model structure
2. **Code Quality** - Implementation standards, error handling, documentation
3. **Performance Validation** - Training metrics, generalization capability
4. **Production Readiness** - Deployment pipeline, scalability, robustness
5. **Scientific Rigor** - Methodology, validation approach, result interpretation

### **Key Questions for Reviewers:**
- Is the multi-modal architecture appropriate for the task?
- Are the training procedures scientifically sound?
- Is the code production-ready and maintainable?
- Do the results demonstrate meaningful predictive capability?
- Are there any critical issues or improvements needed?

## 📊 **Quick Performance Summary**

- **Final Model Performance**: Macro F1 = 0.4019 (40.19%)
- **Training Dataset**: 1,273 terpene synthases with 30 functional ensembles
- **Architecture**: ESM2 (sequence) + Engineered features + GCN (structure)
- **Validation**: Cross-validation + external generalization test (N=30)
- **Deployment**: Production-ready inference pipeline with real AlphaFold structures

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Read the Executive Summary** (`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`) for project overview
2. **Review the Technical Overview** (`TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md`) for architecture details
3. **Follow the Review Guide** (`REVIEW_GUIDE.md`) for systematic evaluation
4. **Examine specific code files** in the `code/` directory
5. **Analyze results** in the `results/` directory

## 📝 **Review Process Recommendations**

1. **Start with Executive Summary** - Understand project goals and outcomes
2. **Review Architecture** - Evaluate design decisions and technical approach
3. **Examine Core Code** - Focus on `code/deployment/TPS_Predictor.py` and training scripts
