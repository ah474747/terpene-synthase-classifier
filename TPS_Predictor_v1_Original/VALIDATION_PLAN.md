## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Data Collection
```bash
# Run validation with real data
python3 validation.py
```

**What it does:**
- Collects terpene synthase sequences from UniProt/NCBI
- Filters by sequence length (200-1000 amino acids)
- Extracts product annotations
- Creates validation dataset

### Step 2: Cross-Validation
```python
# 5-fold cross-validation
cv_results = validator.cross_validate_model(validation_df, 'Random Forest')
```

**Metrics to track:**
- Accuracy: 0.70-0.90 (target)
- Precision: 0.65-0.85 (target)
- Recall: 0.65-0.85 (target)
- F1-score: 0.65-0.85 (target)

### Step 3: Feature Importance Analysis
```python
# Analyze biological relevance
importance_df = validator.analyze_feature_importance(validation_df)
```

**What to look for:**
- Known terpene synthase motifs (DDXXD, NSE, etc.)
- Amino acid composition patterns
- K-mer patterns associated with function

### Step 4: Robustness Testing
```python
# Test across sequence lengths
robustness_results = validator.test_sequence_length_robustness(validation_df)
```

**Test conditions:**
- Short sequences (<300 aa)
- Medium sequences (300-500 aa)
- Long sequences (500-1000 aa)
- Very long sequences (>1000 aa)
